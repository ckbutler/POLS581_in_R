  Output: Your basic calculator can add, substract, multiply, and divide. Many
          basic calculators can also square a number and find the square root of a
          number. In this lesson, you will learn how to do these basic calculations in
          R. We will also explore related concepts.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To add two numbers, you just use the '+' operator, as in '3 + 4'. Try adding 3 and 4 on the command line.
  CorrectAnswer: 3 + 4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='3 + 4')
  Hint: Just type '3 + 4' without quotation marks.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Subtracting numbers similarly uses the '-' operator. Subtract 3 from 4 on the command line.
  CorrectAnswer: 4 - 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='4-3')
  Hint: Remember not to use quotation marks and that order matters.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Multiplying numbers uses the '*' operator. Multiply 3 and 4 on the command line.
  CorrectAnswer: 3 * 4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='3*4')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Dividing numbers uses the '/' operator. Like subtraction, order 
          matters. Find 24 divided by 6.
  CorrectAnswer: 24 / 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='24/6')
  Hint: Remember that order matters. The numerator comes before the denominator.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Some arithmetic operations don't result in a number. Try dividing 1 by 0.
  CorrectAnswer: 1 / 0
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='1/0')
  Hint: It's OK. You won't break the computer. Just type '1 / 0' without the quotations.

- Class: text
  Output: The 'Inf' answer to the previous question stands for 'infinity'. You 
          will also see this written as an 8 on its side, as in âˆž.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Similarly, some operations don't have a defined answer. Try dividing zero by itself.
  CorrectAnswer: 0 / 0
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='0/0')
  Hint: Just type '0 / 0' without the quotation marks.

- Class: text
  Output: The 'NaN' answer stands for 'not a number'. This is important to 
          remember when reading data sets or generating a new variable.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A basic calculator can square a number. This is the same as raising 
          a number to the second power. For example, three squared is the same as 3
          raised to the second power, or '3 ^ 2'. Find five squared.
  CorrectAnswer: 5 ^ 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='5^2')
  Hint: Type '5 ^ 2' without the quotation marks.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Recall that order matters in exponents. 3 ^ 2 is not the same as 2 ^ 3. 
          (Read this as 'Three squared is not the same as two cubed.') Out of curiosity,
          if you flip a penny, a nickle, a dime, and a quarter, how many patterns of 
          heads and tails are there?
  CorrectAnswer: 2 ^ 4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2^4')
  Hint: There are two to the fourth power possibilities, or '2 ^ 4'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The last basic calculator operation is the square root. On the one 
          hand, you could type '9 ^ (1/2)', but this is somewhat combersome. So, let's
          use a function. The sqrt() function can be used to find the square root of 
          a number. Find the square root of 9 using this function.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(9)')
  Hint: Type 'sqrt(9)' without the quotation marks.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Computers give answers only to some specified degree of precision.
          The square root of two is an irrational number (like pi) that has no end. In
          R, you get a truncated version of the number. If asked to give an answer to
          two decimal places, you are further truncating the number. What is the square 
          root of two in R?
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(2)')
  Hint: Type 'sqrt(2)' without the quotation marks.

- Class: text
  Output: Sometimes the wording of arithmetic questions takes a second to sink 
          in. Work through these next questions to make sure you understand terminology.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the difference of 23 and 17.
  CorrectAnswer: 23 - 17
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='23-17')
  Hint: Difference is the same as subtraction. There is a presumption that 
        you are subtracting the second number from the first.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the sum of the numbers 1 through 4.
  CorrectAnswer: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='1+2+3+4')
  Hint: Sum is the same as addition. The phrase 'the numbers 1 through 4' 
        means the integers (or whole numbers) 1, 2 , 3, and 4.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the product of eleven and twelve.
  CorrectAnswer: 11 * 12
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='11*12')
  Hint: Product is the same as multiplication.

- Class: text
  Output: As with square root, there are also functions for arithmetic. The 
          sum() function can be used to add up a series (or array) of numbers
          separated by commas. For example, sum(1, 2, 3, 4) is the same as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.
          The prod() function can be used to find the product of an array of numbers. 
          For example, prod(11, 12) is the same as 11 * 12.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the sum of the numbers 6 through 9 using a function.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(6, 7, 8, 9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum(6, 7, 8, 9)')
  Hint: Type 'sum(6, 7, 8, 9)' without the quotation marks.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the product of the fractions one-half, two-thirds, and 
          three-quarters using a function.
  CorrectAnswer: prod(1/2, 2/3, 3/4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prod(1/2, 2/3, 3/4)')
  Hint: Type 'prod(1/2, 2/3, 3/4)' without the quotation marks. If you tried 
        using decimals, such as 'prod(0.5, 0.67, 0.75)', notice that the answer is 
        not quite the same.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We've implicitly added the use of parentheses. For some calculations,
          parentheses are absolutely necessary. For example, find the difference of nine
          and two divided by three.
  CorrectAnswer: (9 - 2) / 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(9-2)/3')
  Hint: Note that we're not looking for the difference of nine and two-thirds, 
        which would be calculated as '9 - 2/3'. Instead, we need to take the difference
        first, which requires parentheses around the subtraction. You can use 
        the up arrow to bring up your last equation on the command line and then edit it.

  Output: There are more mathematical operators in R. There is a convenient 
          listing at https://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html. There are
          also a variety of mathematical and other functions in R, some of which you 
          can see at https://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html.
