  Lesson: Data Visualization 
  Author: David Nunnally
  Type: Standard
  Organization: University of New Mexico
  Version: 2.4.3

- Class: text
  Output: "In this lesson, you will learn how to visualize patterns in your data using the ggplot2 package."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To begin, you need to load the ggplot2 library. (Note: the data has been loaded for you.)"
  CorrectAnswer: library(ggplot2)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library(ggplot2)')
  Hint: "Type 'library(ggplot2)' without quotation marks. 
        If you have not already, you can install ggplot2 using install.packages('ggplot2')."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, which is the idea that you can build every graph from the same
          components -- a data set, a coordinate system, and geoms (visual marks that represent data points). While the type
          of graph may change, each one derives from the same three essential parts."
          
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's start by making a blank graph. Type ggplot(world, aes(democ11))."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(democ11))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(world, aes(democ11))')
  Hint: "Type ggplot(world, aes(democ11)). You could even copy and paste it!"
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Now you have created a blank graph. Look at this like a canvas; once you have set up your coordinates and data, 
          you can decide what type of graph you want to make and which geoms to add to it. 
          Notice that even though you specified your data (world) and your variable of interest (democ11), 
          ggplot does not assume that you wanted to make a particular graph. 
          You need to specify that you want to add data points."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's turn that blank graph into a histogram. Take your previous command and add '+ geom_histogram()'
          to the end."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(democ11)) + geom_histogram()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(world, aes(democ11)) + geom_histogram()')
  Hint: "Remember not to use quotation marks. You can use the up arrow to recall your previous command."
 
- Class: text
  Output: "Look at the x axis of the histogram. Its break points are 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0. These points
          illustrate potential democracy scores that countries could have 
          (0 indicates fully autocratic while 10 indicates fully democratic), while break points on the y axis
          indicate how many countries have those scores."
          
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's practice using another variable. This time, make a histogram using the 'cialifex' variable."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram()')
  Hint: "Remember not to use quotation marks. You can use the up arrow to recall your previous command and add your new variable." 
          
- Class: text
  Output: "You can make a histogram and other plots using commands other than ggplot, and some of which are much simpler.
          However, ggplot allows you to control more about the graph itself."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "For example, let's change the bin width of the x axis so that there are no spaces between the 
          cut points. Using the 'cialifex' variable (average life expectancy in a country), add 'breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5)'
          inside the geom_histogram() part of the command."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5))')
  Hint: "Remember not to use quotation marks. You can use the up arrow to recall your previous command."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "In the breaks specification above, '35, 90' indicates that you would like to graph values between 
          35 and 90. 'by=5' indicates that you would like the bars (bins) to reflect every five years of life." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "This graph lacks color... let's make the bins blue! 
          Add 'fill=blue' (with blue in single quotation marks) to the 'geom_histogram' part of your command. 
          Don't forget to add a comma."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue')")
  Hint: "Type ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue')."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "You can also delineate each bin by outlining them in another color. Let's use red. After specifying
          your fill color (blue), specify your outline color using 'col=red' (with red in single quotation marks).
          Don't forget commas where appropriate."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red')")
  Hint: "Type ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red')."

- Class: text
  Output: "The 'col=' specification can be used to change the color of other graphs as well. While color printing
          for research papers may be unnecessary, adding color can make your graphics 'pop' when presenting research
          at conferences."
          
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now that you have a (more) beautiful histogram, let's add a variable label to enhance clarity.
          While you might know what 'cialifex' means, others might not. This can be done using the handy
          labs() function. At the end of your previous command,
          add '+ labs(x=Average life expectancy)'. Remember -- your new label name needs to be
          inside single quotation marks."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red') + labs(x='Average life expectancy')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red') + labs(x='Average life expectancy')")
  Hint: "Type ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red') 
        + labs(x='Average life expectancy')"
        
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "labs() can also be used to make a title for your graph. Including a title is a good habit
          because readers do not need to exert as much effort to understand what they are looking at. Building
          off of your previous command, add 'title=This is a title' inside the labs() function.
          Your title should be in single quotation marks. Don't forget commas where appropriate."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red') + labs(x='Average life expectancy', title='This is a title')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red') + labs(x='Average life expectancy', title='This is a title')")
  Hint: "Type ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(35, 90, by=5), fill='blue', col='red') 
        + labs(x='Average life expectancy', title='This is a title')"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Histograms are not the only way to visualize data for one variable. 
           Kernel density plots provide a useful alternative for when you have continuous variables. 
           Set up the ggplot command like a histogram, but add 
          'geom_density' at the end instead of 'geom_histogram'. Continue to use 'cialifex' as your variable." 
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_density()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_density()')
  Hint: "Type 'ggplot(world, aes(cialifex)) + geom_density()' without quotation marks."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Unlike the histogram, the kernel density plot outputs a probability distribution for each x value on
          the y axis. For countries' average life expectancy, the most likely value falls between 75 and 77."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Finally, we're ready to move on to scatter plots. These graphs plot the relationship between two 
          (often continuous) variables. Let's start with a blank graph to illustrate what this means. Type
          'ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII))'."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII))')
  Hint: "Type ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII)). Remember not to use quotation marks."

- Class: text
  Output: "On the blank graph, the x axis plots percentage of GDP that a country spends on education; 
          the y axis plots the Gender Inequality Index -- where higher values indicate higher inequality. 
          By plotting both variables, we can determine whether a pattern between them exists."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Modify the blank graph by adding '+ geom_point()' to the end."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII)) + geom_point()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII)) + geom_point()')
  Hint: "Remember not to use quotation marks. You can use the up arrow to recall your previous command."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Sometimes relationships can be hard to identify from scatter plots. We can plot a line of best fit
          to make the relationship more transparent. Add '+ geom_smooth(method=lm)' to the end 
          of your previous command. lm should be in single quotation marks."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm')")
  Hint: "You can use the up arrow to recall your previous command."

- Class: text
  Output: "Specifying 'method=lm' indicates that you want a linear model as your line of best fit. The ggplot2
          package comes with many other options that you can use if you feel that a linear model is not
          appropriate. The gray bands illustrate the confidence interval. You can remove the bands by adding
          'se=FALSE' inside geom_smooth()."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's practice adding labels to the scatterplot to make it look nicer. Inside the function, 
          add 'x=Education Spending (Percent of GDP), y=Gender Inequality Index'. Remember to put your labels
          inside single quotation marks."
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm') + labs(x='Education Spending (Percent of GDP)', y='Gender Inequality Index')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("ggplot(world, aes(x=ciaedex, y=UN_GII)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm') + labs(x='Education Spending (Percent of GDP)', y='Gender Inequality Index')")
  Hint: "You can use the up arrow to recall your previous command."

- Class: text
  Output: "Well that was arduous! This lesson covered the basics of data visualization, including histograms,
          kernel density plots, scatter plots, how to change the title and labels, how to change scaling,
          and how to change colors, among other things. R can do so much more -- some of which you will learn
          later on. You can also read ahead; many individuals have uploaded useful visualization tutorials
          online."
