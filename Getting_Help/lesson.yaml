  Output: "This lesson will show you how to get help in the RStudio environment. One of the big advantages of using RStudio to write R code is the large built-in help system. RStudio can tell you how to use functions, direct you to new functions, provide extended examples, and give you access to sample data. Remember, help is your friend!"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To launch a help page for a specific function, use the 'help()' function. Using the console, ask for help with the 'setwd()' function by typing 'help(setwd).' In typical setups, it will open an HTML page the lower right hand pane in RStudio."
  CorrectAnswer: help(setwd)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('help(setwd)')
  Hint: "Type help(setwd)."

- Class: text
  Output: "You can also get help with a function with a question mark before the function name, like this: ?setwd."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "If you're unsure about which function you need help with, use the 'apropos()' command. The 'apropos' command will return a list of functions containing the word you searched for---as long as you put the word you'd like to search for in quotes. For example, type 'apropos('help')' below to return all functions containing the word help."
  CorrectAnswer: apropos('help')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('apropos("help")')
  Hint: 'Type apropos("help").'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "RStudio will also provide you with examples of how to use a function, complete with sample input and expected output. The 'example()' command will return a brief look at functions in action; it may ask you to press 'Enter' or 'Return' to navigate between examples. Type 'example(plot)' to examine the 'plot()' function. In a typical setup, you will see a few different plots open in the lower right-hand pane of RStudio."
  CorrectAnswer: example(plot)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('example(plot)')
  Hint: "Type example(plot)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Some packages come pre-loaded with powerful tutorials called vignettes, which walk you through function inputs, options, and outputs with detailed comments and sample data. To see what vignettes are available on your system, use the 'vignette()' command. In the typical configuration, this function will open an HTML page the upper left-hand viewing pane of RStudio. Type 'vignette()' below to continue."
  CorrectAnswer: vignette()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('vignette()')
  Hint: "Type vignette()."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To launch a vignette, note the name of the tutorial from the vignette list and then use the 'vignette()' command with the name of the tutorial as an input in quotes. For example, to start the 'Intro2Matrix' vignette, type 'vignette('Intro2Matrix')' below. It will open a PDF in an external viewer."
  CorrectAnswer: vignette("Intro2Matrix")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('vignette("Intro2Matrix")')
  Hint: 'Type vignette("Intro2Matrix").'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Finally, RStudio comes pre-loaded with example data sets to practice on. Obtain a list of available datasets with the 'data()' command below."
  CorrectAnswer: data()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data()')
  Hint: "Type data()."

- Class: text
  Output: "In addition to built-in help functions, you can find plenty of help for R programming on the internet. Popular and helpful sites include https://stackoverflow.com, https://community.rstudio.com, and your favorite search engine."

- Class: text
  Output: "You have finished the Getting Help lesson. In this lesson, you have learned how to get help with specific commands, find examples of functions, examine vignettes, and retrieve sample data."
